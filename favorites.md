# diff History for Long-Context Language Agents

## Authors

## Abstract
Language Models (LMs) offer an exciting solution for general-purpose embodied control. However, a key technical issue arises when using an LM-based controller: environment observations must be converted to text, which coupled with history, leads to prohibitively large textual prompts. As a result, prior work in LM agents is limited to restricted domains with either small observation size or minimal needs for interaction history. In this paper, we introduce a simple and highly effective solution to these issues. We exploit the fact that consecutive text observations have high similarity and propose to compress them via the Unix diff command. We demonstrate our approach in NetHack, a complex rogue-like video game, that requires long-horizon reasoning for decision-making and is far from solved, particularly for neural agents. Diff history offers an average of 4x increase in the length of the text-based interaction history available to the LM. This observational compression along with the benefits of abstraction yields a 7x improvement in game score on held-out environment instances over state-of-the-art baselines. It also outperforms prior agents that use visual observations by over 40%.

# PEEKABOO: Interactive Video Generation via Masked-Diffusion

## Authors
Yash Jain, Anshul Nasery, Vibhav Vineet, Harkirat Behl

## Abstract
Recently there has been a lot of progress in text-to-video generation, with state-of-the-art models being capable of generating high quality, realistic videos. However, these models lack the capability for users to interactively control and generate videos, which can potentially unlock new areas of application. As a first step towards this goal, we tackle the problem of endowing diffusion-based video generation models with interactive spatio-temporal control over their output. To this end, we take inspiration from the recent advances in segmentation literature to propose a novel spatio-temporal masked attention module - Peekaboo. This module is a training-free, no-inference-overhead addition to off-the-shelf video generation models which enables spatio-temporal control. We also propose an evaluation benchmark for the interactive video generation task. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation, we establish that Peekaboo enables control video generation and even obtains a gain of upto 3.8x in mIoU over baseline models.

# Multi-Modal Conformal Prediction Regions by Optimizing Convex Shape Templates

## Authors
Renukanandan Tumu, Matthew Cleaveland, Rahul Mangharam, George J. Pappas, Lars Lindemann

## Abstract
Conformal prediction is a statistical tool for producing prediction regions for machine learning models that are valid with high probability. A key component of conformal prediction algorithms is a non-conformity score function that quantifies how different a model's prediction is from the unknown ground truth value. Essentially, these functions determine the shape and the size of the conformal prediction regions. However, little work has gone into finding non-conformity score functions that produce prediction regions that are multi-modal and practical, i.e., that can efficiently be used in engineering applications. We propose a method that optimizes parameterized shape template functions over calibration data, which results in non-conformity score functions that produce prediction regions with minimum volume. Our approach results in prediction regions that are multi-modal, so they can properly capture residuals of distributions that have multiple modes, and practical, so each region is convex and can be easily incorporated into downstream tasks, such as a motion planner using conformal prediction regions. Our method applies to general supervised learning tasks, while we illustrate its use in time-series prediction. We provide a toolbox and present illustrative case studies of F16 fighter jets and autonomous vehicles, showing an up to $68\%$ reduction in prediction region area.

# Cross-modal Contrastive Learning with Asymmetric Co-attention Network for Video Moment Retrieval

## Authors
Love Panta, Prashant Shrestha, Brabeem Sapkota, Amrita Bhattarai, Suresh Manandhar, Anand Kumar Sah

## Abstract
Video moment retrieval is a challenging task requiring fine-grained interactions between video and text modalities. Recent work in image-text pretraining has demonstrated that most existing pretrained models suffer from information asymmetry due to the difference in length between visual and textual sequences. We question whether the same problem also exists in the video-text domain with an auxiliary need to preserve both spatial and temporal information. Thus, we evaluate a recently proposed solution involving the addition of an asymmetric co-attention network for video grounding tasks. Additionally, we incorporate momentum contrastive loss for robust, discriminative representation learning in both modalities. We note that the integration of these supplementary modules yields better performance compared to state-of-the-art models on the TACoS dataset and comparable results on ActivityNet Captions, all while utilizing significantly fewer parameters with respect to baseline.

# How Well Does GPT-4V(ision) Adapt to Distribution Shifts? A Preliminary Investigation

## Authors
Zhongyi Han, Guanglin Zhou, Rundong He, Jindong Wang, Xing Xie, Tailin Wu, Yilong Yin, Salman Khan, Lina Yao, Tongliang Liu, Kun Zhang

## Abstract
In machine learning, generalization against distribution shifts -- where deployment conditions diverge from the training scenarios -- is crucial, particularly in fields like climate modeling, biomedicine, and autonomous driving. The emergence of foundation models, distinguished by their extensive pretraining and task versatility, has led to an increased interest in their adaptability to distribution shifts. GPT-4V(ision) acts as the most advanced publicly accessible multimodal foundation model, with extensive applications across various domains, including anomaly detection, video understanding, image generation, and medical diagnosis. However, its robustness against data distributions remains largely underexplored. Addressing this gap, this study rigorously evaluates GPT-4V's adaptability and generalization capabilities in dynamic environments, benchmarking against prominent models like CLIP and LLaVA. We delve into GPT-4V's zero-shot generalization across 13 diverse datasets spanning natural, medical, and molecular domains. We further investigate its adaptability to controlled data perturbations and examine the efficacy of in-context learning as a tool to enhance its adaptation. Our findings delineate GPT-4V's capability boundaries in distribution shifts, shedding light on its strengths and limitations across various scenarios. Importantly, this investigation contributes to our understanding of how AI foundation models generalize to distribution shifts, offering pivotal insights into their adaptability and robustness. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/jameszhou-gl/gpt-4v-distribution-shift.

# Text2AC-Zero: Consistent Synthesis of Animated Characters using 2D Diffusion

## Authors
Abdelrahman Eldesokey, Peter Wonka

## Abstract
We propose a zero-shot approach for consistent Text-to-Animated-Characters synthesis based on pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models. Existing Text-to-Video (T2V) methods are expensive to train and require large-scale video datasets to produce diverse characters and motions. At the same time, their zero-shot alternatives fail to produce temporally consistent videos. We strive to bridge this gap, and we introduce a zero-shot approach that produces temporally consistent videos of animated characters and requires no training or fine-tuning. We leverage existing text-based motion diffusion models to generate diverse motions that we utilize to guide a T2I model. To achieve temporal consistency, we introduce the Spatial Latent Alignment module that exploits cross-frame dense correspondences that we compute to align the latents of the video frames. Furthermore, we propose Pixel-Wise Guidance to steer the diffusion process in a direction that minimizes visual discrepancies. Our proposed approach generates temporally consistent videos with diverse motions and styles, outperforming existing zero-shot T2V approaches in terms of pixel-wise consistency and user preference.

# Generating High-Resolution Regional Precipitation Using Conditional Diffusion Model

## Authors
Naufal Shidqi, Chaeyoon Jeong, Sungwon Park, Elke Zeller, Arjun Babu Nellikkattil, Karandeep Singh

## Abstract
Climate downscaling is a crucial technique within climate research, serving to project low-resolution (LR) climate data to higher resolutions (HR). Previous research has demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning for downscaling tasks. However, most deep learning models for climate downscaling may not perform optimally for high scaling factors (i.e., 4x, 8x) due to their limited ability to capture the intricate details required for generating HR climate data. Furthermore, climate data behaves differently from image data, necessitating a nuanced approach when employing deep generative models. In response to these challenges, this paper presents a deep generative model for downscaling climate data, specifically precipitation on a regional scale. We employ a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) conditioned on multiple LR climate variables. The proposed model is evaluated using precipitation data from the Community Earth System Model (CESM) v1.2.2 simulation. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over existing baselines, underscoring the effectiveness of the conditional diffusion model in downscaling climate data.

# Rethinking Compression: Reduced Order Modelling of Latent Features in Large Language Models

## Authors
Arnav Chavan, Nahush Lele, Deepak Gupta

## Abstract
Due to the substantial scale of Large Language Models (LLMs), the direct application of conventional compression methodologies proves impractical. The computational demands associated with even minimal gradient updates present challenges, particularly on consumer-grade hardware. This paper introduces an innovative approach for the parametric and practical compression of LLMs based on reduced order modelling, which entails low-rank decomposition within the feature space and re-parameterization in the weight space. Notably, this compression technique operates in a layer-wise manner, obviating the need for a GPU device and enabling the compression of billion-scale models within stringent constraints of both memory and time. Our method represents a significant advancement in model compression by leveraging matrix decomposition, demonstrating superior efficacy compared to the prevailing state-of-the-art structured pruning method.

# Humans vs Large Language Models: Judgmental Forecasting in an Era of Advanced AI

## Authors
MAhdi Abolghasemi, Odkhishig Ganbold, Kristian Rotaru

## Abstract
This study investigates the forecasting accuracy of human experts versus Large Language Models (LLMs) in the retail sector, particularly during standard and promotional sales periods. Utilizing a controlled experimental setup with 123 human forecasters and five LLMs, including ChatGPT4, ChatGPT3.5, Bard, Bing, and Llama2, we evaluated forecasting precision through Mean Absolute Percentage Error. Our analysis centered on the effect of the following factors on forecasters performance: the supporting statistical model (baseline and advanced), whether the product was on promotion, and the nature of external impact. The findings indicate that LLMs do not consistently outperform humans in forecasting accuracy and that advanced statistical forecasting models do not uniformly enhance the performance of either human forecasters or LLMs. Both human and LLM forecasters exhibited increased forecasting errors, particularly during promotional periods and under the influence of positive external impacts. Our findings call for careful consideration when integrating LLMs into practical forecasting processes.

# LoRA-Enhanced Distillation on Guided Diffusion Models

## Authors
Pareesa Ameneh Golnari

## Abstract
Diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), offer the ability to generate high-resolution images with diverse features, but they come at a significant computational and memory cost. In classifier-free guided diffusion models, prolonged inference times are attributed to the necessity of computing two separate diffusion models at each denoising step. Recent work has shown promise in improving inference time through distillation techniques, teaching the model to perform similar denoising steps with reduced computations. However, the application of distillation introduces additional memory overhead to these already resource-intensive diffusion models, making it less practical.   To address these challenges, our research explores a novel approach that combines Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with model distillation to efficiently compress diffusion models. This approach not only reduces inference time but also mitigates memory overhead, and notably decreases memory consumption even before applying distillation. The results are remarkable, featuring a significant reduction in inference time due to the distillation process and a substantial 50% reduction in memory consumption. Our examination of the generated images underscores that the incorporation of LoRA-enhanced distillation maintains image quality and alignment with the provided prompts. In summary, while conventional distillation tends to increase memory consumption, LoRA-enhanced distillation offers optimization without any trade-offs or compromises in quality.

# Probing Commonsense Reasoning Capability of Text-to-Image Generative Models via Non-visual Description

## Authors
Mianzhi Pan, Jianfei Li, Mingyue Yu, Zheng Ma, Kanzhi Cheng, Jianbing Zhang, Jiajun Chen

## Abstract
Commonsense reasoning, the ability to make logical assumptions about daily scenes, is one core intelligence of human beings. In this work, we present a novel task and dataset for evaluating the ability of text-to-image generative models to conduct commonsense reasoning, which we call PAINTaboo. Given a description with few visual clues of one object, the goal is to generate images illustrating the object correctly. The dataset was carefully hand-curated and covered diverse object categories to analyze model performance comprehensively. Our investigation of several prevalent text-to-image generative models reveals that these models are not proficient in commonsense reasoning, as anticipated. We trust that PAINTaboo can improve our understanding of the reasoning abilities of text-to-image generative models.

# More than Vanilla Fusion: a Simple, Decoupling-free, Attention Module for Multimodal Fusion Based on Signal Theory

## Authors
Peiwen Sun, Yifan Zhang, Zishan Liu, Donghao Chen, Honggang Zhang

## Abstract
The vanilla fusion methods still dominate a large percentage of mainstream audio-visual tasks. However, the effectiveness of vanilla fusion from a theoretical perspective is still worth discussing. Thus, this paper reconsiders the signal fused in the multimodal case from a bionics perspective and proposes a simple, plug-and-play, attention module for vanilla fusion based on fundamental signal theory and uncertainty theory. In addition, previous work on multimodal dynamic gradient modulation still relies on decoupling the modalities. So, a decoupling-free gradient modulation scheme has been designed in conjunction with the aforementioned attention module, which has various advantages over the decoupled one. Experiment results show that just a few lines of code can achieve up to 2.0% performance improvements to several multimodal classification methods. Finally, quantitative evaluation of other fusion tasks reveals the potential for additional application scenarios.

# diff History for Long-Context Language Agents

## Authors
Ulyana Piterbarg, Lerrel Pinto, Rob Fergus

## Abstract
Language Models (LMs) offer an exciting solution for general-purpose embodied control. However, a key technical issue arises when using an LM-based controller: environment observations must be converted to text, which coupled with history, leads to prohibitively large textual prompts. As a result, prior work in LM agents is limited to restricted domains with either small observation size or minimal needs for interaction history. In this paper, we introduce a simple and highly effective solution to these issues. We exploit the fact that consecutive text observations have high similarity and propose to compress them via the Unix diff command. We demonstrate our approach in NetHack, a complex rogue-like video game, that requires long-horizon reasoning for decision-making and is far from solved, particularly for neural agents. Diff history offers an average of 4x increase in the length of the text-based interaction history available to the LM. This observational compression along with the benefits of abstraction yields a 7x improvement in game score on held-out environment instances over state-of-the-art baselines. It also outperforms prior agents that use visual observations by over 40%.

# Interfacing Foundation Models' Embeddings

## Authors
Xueyan Zou, Linjie Li, Jianfeng Wang, Jianwei Yang, Mingyu Ding, Zhengyuan Yang, Feng Li, Hao Zhang, Shilong Liu, Arul Aravinthan, Yong Jae Lee, Lijuan Wang

## Abstract
We present FIND, a generalized interface for aligning foundation models' embeddings. As shown in teaser figure, a lightweight transformer interface without tuning any foundation model weights is enough for a unified image (segmentation) and dataset-level (retrieval) understanding. The proposed interface has the following favorable attributes: (1) Generalizable. It applies to various tasks spanning retrieval, segmentation, \textit{etc.}, under the same architecture and weights. (2) Prototypable. Different tasks are able to be implemented through prototyping attention masks and embedding types. (3) Extendable. The proposed interface is adaptive to new tasks, and new models. (4) Interleavable. With the benefit of multi-task multi-modal training, the proposed interface creates an interleaved shared embedding space. In light of the interleaved embedding space, we introduce the FIND-Bench, which introduces new training and evaluation annotations to the COCO dataset for interleave segmentation and retrieval. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on FIND-Bench and competitive performance on standard retrieval and segmentation settings. The training, evaluation, and demo code as well as the dataset have been released at https://github.com/UX-Decoder/FIND.

# LLMEval: A Preliminary Study on How to Evaluate Large Language Models

## Authors
Yue Zhang, Ming Zhang, Haipeng Yuan, Shichun Liu, Yongyao Shi, Tao Gui, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang

## Abstract
Recently, the evaluation of Large Language Models has emerged as a popular area of research. The three crucial questions for LLM evaluation are ``what, where, and how to evaluate''. However, the existing research mainly focuses on the first two questions, which are basically what tasks to give the LLM during testing and what kind of knowledge it should deal with. As for the third question, which is about what standards to use, the types of evaluators, how to score, and how to rank, there hasn't been much discussion. In this paper, we analyze evaluation methods by comparing various criteria with both manual and automatic evaluation, utilizing onsite, crowd-sourcing, public annotators and GPT-4, with different scoring methods and ranking systems. We propose a new dataset, LLMEval and conduct evaluations on 20 LLMs. A total of 2,186 individuals participated, leading to the generation of 243,337 manual annotations and 57,511 automatic evaluation results. We perform comparisons and analyses of different settings and conduct 10 conclusions that can provide some insights for evaluating LLM in the future. The dataset and the results are publicly available at https://github.com/llmeval .

# A Unified Sampling Framework for Solver Searching of Diffusion Probabilistic Models

## Authors
Enshu Liu, Xuefei Ning, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang

## Abstract
Recent years have witnessed the rapid progress and broad application of diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs). Sampling from DPMs can be viewed as solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Despite the promising performance, the generation of DPMs usually consumes much time due to the large number of function evaluations (NFE). Though recent works have accelerated the sampling to around 20 steps with high-order solvers, the sample quality with less than 10 NFE can still be improved. In this paper, we propose a unified sampling framework (USF) to study the optional strategies for solver. Under this framework, we further reveal that taking different solving strategies at different timesteps may help further decrease the truncation error, and a carefully designed \emph{solver schedule} has the potential to improve the sample quality by a large margin. Therefore, we propose a new sampling framework based on the exponential integral formulation that allows free choices of solver strategy at each step and design specific decisions for the framework. Moreover, we propose $S^3$, a predictor-based search method that automatically optimizes the solver schedule to get a better time-quality trade-off of sampling. We demonstrate that $S^3$ can find outstanding solver schedules which outperform the state-of-the-art sampling methods on CIFAR-10, CelebA, ImageNet, and LSUN-Bedroom datasets. Specifically, we achieve 2.69 FID with 10 NFE and 6.86 FID with 5 NFE on CIFAR-10 dataset, outperforming the SOTA method significantly. We further apply $S^3$ to Stable-Diffusion model and get an acceleration ratio of 2$\times$, showing the feasibility of sampling in very few steps without retraining the neural network.

# Divide-and-Conquer Attack: Harnessing the Power of LLM to Bypass the Censorship of Text-to-Image Generation Model

## Authors
Yimo Deng, Huangxun Chen

## Abstract
Text-to-image generative models offer many innovative services but also raise ethical concerns due to their potential to generate unethical images. Most publicly available text-to-image models employ safety filters to prevent unintended generation intents. In this work, we introduce the Divide-and-Conquer Attack to circumvent the safety filters of state-of-the-art text-to-image models. Our attack leverages LLMs as agents for text transformation, creating adversarial prompts from sensitive ones. We have developed effective helper prompts that enable LLMs to break down sensitive drawing prompts into multiple harmless descriptions, allowing them to bypass safety filters while still generating sensitive images. This means that the latent harmful meaning only becomes apparent when all individual elements are drawn together. Our evaluation demonstrates that our attack successfully circumvents the closed-box safety filter of SOTA DALLE-3 integrated natively into ChatGPT to generate unethical images. This approach, which essentially uses LLM-generated adversarial prompts against GPT-4-assisted DALLE-3, is akin to using one's own spear to breach their shield. It could have more severe security implications than previous manual crafting or iterative model querying methods, and we hope it stimulates more attention towards similar efforts. Our code and data are available at: https://github.com/researchcode001/Divide-and-Conquer-Attack

# Navigating the generative AI era: Introducing the AI assessment scale for ethical GenAI assessment

## Authors
Mike Perkins, Leon Furze, Jasper Roe, Jason MacVaugh

## Abstract
Recent developments in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) have created a paradigm shift in multiple areas of society, and the use of these technologies is likely to become a defining feature of education in coming decades. GenAI offers transformative pedagogical opportunities, while simultaneously posing ethical and academic challenges. Against this backdrop, we outline a practical, simple, and sufficiently comprehensive tool to allow for the integration of GenAI tools into educational assessment: the AI Assessment Scale (AIAS). The AIAS empowers educators to select the appropriate level of GenAI usage in assessments based on the learning outcomes they seek to address. The AIAS offers greater clarity and transparency for students and educators, provides a fair and equitable policy tool for institutions to work with, and offers a nuanced approach which embraces the opportunities of GenAI while recognising that there are instances where such tools may not be pedagogically appropriate or necessary. By adopting a practical, flexible approach that can be implemented quickly, the AIAS can form a much-needed starting point to address the current uncertainty and anxiety regarding GenAI in education. As a secondary objective, we engage with the current literature and advocate for a refocused discourse on GenAI tools in education, one which foregrounds how technologies can help support and enhance teaching and learning, which contrasts with the current focus on GenAI as a facilitator of academic misconduct.

# Context Matter: Data-Efficient Augmentation of Large Language Models for Scientific Applications

## Authors
Xiang Li, Haoran Tang, Siyu Chen, Ziwei Wang, Anurag Maravi, Marcin Abram

## Abstract
In this paper, we explore the challenges inherent to Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4, particularly their propensity for hallucinations, logic mistakes, and incorrect conclusions when tasked with answering complex questions. The capacity of LLMs to present erroneous answers in a coherent and semantically rigorous manner further complicates the detection of factual inaccuracies. This issue is especially pronounced in fields that require specialized expertise. Our work delves into these challenges, aiming to enhance the understanding and mitigation of such errors, thereby contributing to the improvement of LLM accuracy and reliability in scientific and other specialized domains. Our findings reveal a non-linear relationship between the context's relevancy and the answers' measured quality. In addition, we demonstrate that with the correct calibration, it is possible to automate the grading procedure -- a finding suggesting that, at least to some degree, the LLMs can be used to self-examine the quality of their own performance. Finally, we describe an experimental platform that can be seen as a proof-of-concept of the techniques described in this work.

# FreeInit: Bridging Initialization Gap in Video Diffusion Models

## Authors
Tianxing Wu, Chenyang Si, Yuming Jiang, Ziqi Huang, Ziwei Liu

## Abstract
Though diffusion-based video generation has witnessed rapid progress, the inference results of existing models still exhibit unsatisfactory temporal consistency and unnatural dynamics. In this paper, we delve deep into the noise initialization of video diffusion models, and discover an implicit training-inference gap that attributes to the unsatisfactory inference quality. Our key findings are: 1) the spatial-temporal frequency distribution of the initial latent at inference is intrinsically different from that for training, and 2) the denoising process is significantly influenced by the low-frequency components of the initial noise. Motivated by these observations, we propose a concise yet effective inference sampling strategy, FreeInit, which significantly improves temporal consistency of videos generated by diffusion models. Through iteratively refining the spatial-temporal low-frequency components of the initial latent during inference, FreeInit is able to compensate the initialization gap between training and inference, thus effectively improving the subject appearance and temporal consistency of generation results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FreeInit consistently enhances the generation results of various text-to-video generation models without additional training.

# FreeControl: Training-Free Spatial Control of Any Text-to-Image Diffusion Model with Any Condition

## Authors

## Abstract
Recent approaches such as ControlNet offer users fine-grained spatial control over text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. However, auxiliary modules have to be trained for each type of spatial condition, model architecture, and checkpoint, putting them at odds with the diverse intents and preferences a human designer would like to convey to the AI models during the content creation process. In this work, we present FreeControl, a training-free approach for controllable T2I generation that supports multiple conditions, architectures, and checkpoints simultaneously. FreeControl designs structure guidance to facilitate the structure alignment with a guidance image, and appearance guidance to enable the appearance sharing between images generated using the same seed. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the superior performance of FreeControl across a variety of pre-trained T2I models. In particular, FreeControl facilitates convenient training-free control over many different architectures and checkpoints, allows the challenging input conditions on which most of the existing training-free methods fail, and achieves competitive synthesis quality with training-based approaches.

# VILA: On Pre-training for Visual Language Models

## Authors
Ji Lin, Hongxu Yin, Wei Ping, Yao Lu, Pavlo Molchanov, Andrew Tao, Huizi Mao, Jan Kautz, Mohammad Shoeybi, Song Han

## Abstract
Visual language models (VLMs) rapidly progressed with the recent success of large language models. There have been growing efforts on visual instruction tuning to extend the LLM with visual inputs, but lacks an in-depth study of the visual language pre-training process, where the model learns to perform joint modeling on both modalities. In this work, we examine the design options for VLM pre-training by augmenting LLM towards VLM through step-by-step controllable comparisons. We introduce three main findings: (1) freezing LLMs during pre-training can achieve decent zero-shot performance, but lack in-context learning capability, which requires unfreezing the LLM; (2) interleaved pre-training data is beneficial whereas image-text pairs alone are not optimal; (3) re-blending text-only instruction data to image-text data during instruction fine-tuning not only remedies the degradation of text-only tasks, but also boosts VLM task accuracy. With an enhanced pre-training recipe we build VILA, a Visual Language model family that consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art models, e.g., LLaVA-1.5, across main benchmarks without bells and whistles. Multi-modal pre-training also helps unveil appealing properties of VILA, including multi-image reasoning, enhanced in-context learning, and better world knowledge.

## Authors

## Abstract
We present FIND, a generalized interface for aligning foundation models' embeddings. As shown in teaser figure, a lightweight transformer interface without tuning any foundation model weights is enough for a unified image (segmentation) and dataset-level (retrieval) understanding. The proposed interface has the following favorable attributes: (1) Generalizable. It applies to various tasks spanning retrieval, segmentation, \textit{etc.}, under the same architecture and weights. (2) Prototypable. Different tasks are able to be implemented through prototyping attention masks and embedding types. (3) Extendable. The proposed interface is adaptive to new tasks, and new models. (4) Interleavable. With the benefit of multi-task multi-modal training, the proposed interface creates an interleaved shared embedding space. In light of the interleaved embedding space, we introduce the FIND-Bench, which introduces new training and evaluation annotations to the COCO dataset for interleave segmentation and retrieval. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on FIND-Bench and competitive performance on standard retrieval and segmentation settings. The training, evaluation, and demo code as well as the dataset have been released at https://github.com/UX-Decoder/FIND.

# PEEKABOO: Interactive Video Generation via Masked-Diffusion

## Authors
Yash Jain, Anshul Nasery, Vibhav Vineet, Harkirat Behl

## Abstract
Recently there has been a lot of progress in text-to-video generation, with state-of-the-art models being capable of generating high quality, realistic videos. However, these models lack the capability for users to interactively control and generate videos, which can potentially unlock new areas of application. As a first step towards this goal, we tackle the problem of endowing diffusion-based video generation models with interactive spatio-temporal control over their output. To this end, we take inspiration from the recent advances in segmentation literature to propose a novel spatio-temporal masked attention module - Peekaboo. This module is a training-free, no-inference-overhead addition to off-the-shelf video generation models which enables spatio-temporal control. We also propose an evaluation benchmark for the interactive video generation task. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation, we establish that Peekaboo enables control video generation and even obtains a gain of upto 3.8x in mIoU over baseline models.

# Multi-Branch Network for Imagery Emotion Prediction

## Authors
Quoc-Bao Ninh, Hai-Chan Nguyen, Triet Huynh, Trung-Nghia Le

## Abstract
For a long time, images have proved perfect at both storing and conveying rich semantics, especially human emotions. A lot of research has been conducted to provide machines with the ability to recognize emotions in photos of people. Previous methods mostly focus on facial expressions but fail to consider the scene context, meanwhile scene context plays an important role in predicting emotions, leading to more accurate results. In addition, Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) values offer a more precise quantitative understanding of continuous emotions, yet there has been less emphasis on predicting them compared to discrete emotional categories. In this paper, we present a novel Multi-Branch Network (MBN), which utilizes various source information, including faces, bodies, and scene contexts to predict both discrete and continuous emotions in an image. Experimental results on EMOTIC dataset, which contains large-scale images of people in unconstrained situations labeled with 26 discrete categories of emotions and VAD values, show that our proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with 28.4% in mAP and 0.93 in MAE. The results highlight the importance of utilizing multiple contextual information in emotion prediction and illustrate the potential of our proposed method in a wide range of applications, such as effective computing, human-computer interaction, and social robotics.

# How Well Does GPT-4V(ision) Adapt to Distribution Shifts? A Preliminary Investigation

## Authors

## Abstract
In machine learning, generalization against distribution shifts -- where deployment conditions diverge from the training scenarios -- is crucial, particularly in fields like climate modeling, biomedicine, and autonomous driving. The emergence of foundation models, distinguished by their extensive pretraining and task versatility, has led to an increased interest in their adaptability to distribution shifts. GPT-4V(ision) acts as the most advanced publicly accessible multimodal foundation model, with extensive applications across various domains, including anomaly detection, video understanding, image generation, and medical diagnosis. However, its robustness against data distributions remains largely underexplored. Addressing this gap, this study rigorously evaluates GPT-4V's adaptability and generalization capabilities in dynamic environments, benchmarking against prominent models like CLIP and LLaVA. We delve into GPT-4V's zero-shot generalization across 13 diverse datasets spanning natural, medical, and molecular domains. We further investigate its adaptability to controlled data perturbations and examine the efficacy of in-context learning as a tool to enhance its adaptation. Our findings delineate GPT-4V's capability boundaries in distribution shifts, shedding light on its strengths and limitations across various scenarios. Importantly, this investigation contributes to our understanding of how AI foundation models generalize to distribution shifts, offering pivotal insights into their adaptability and robustness. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/jameszhou-gl/gpt-4v-distribution-shift.

# DiffMorpher: Unleashing the Capability of Diffusion Models for Image Morphing

## Authors
Kaiwen Zhang, Yifan Zhou, Xudong Xu, Xingang Pan, Bo Dai

## Abstract
Diffusion models have achieved remarkable image generation quality surpassing previous generative models. However, a notable limitation of diffusion models, in comparison to GANs, is their difficulty in smoothly interpolating between two image samples, due to their highly unstructured latent space. Such a smooth interpolation is intriguing as it naturally serves as a solution for the image morphing task with many applications. In this work, we present DiffMorpher, the first approach enabling smooth and natural image interpolation using diffusion models. Our key idea is to capture the semantics of the two images by fitting two LoRAs to them respectively, and interpolate between both the LoRA parameters and the latent noises to ensure a smooth semantic transition, where correspondence automatically emerges without the need for annotation. In addition, we propose an attention interpolation and injection technique and a new sampling schedule to further enhance the smoothness between consecutive images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffMorpher achieves starkly better image morphing effects than previous methods across a variety of object categories, bridging a critical functional gap that distinguished diffusion models from GANs.

# A Simple Recipe for Contrastively Pre-training Video-First Encoders Beyond 16 Frames

## Authors

## Abstract
Understanding long, real-world videos requires modeling of long-range visual dependencies. To this end, we explore video-first architectures, building on the common paradigm of transferring large-scale, image--text models to video via shallow temporal fusion. However, we expose two limitations to the approach: (1) decreased spatial capabilities, likely due to poor video--language alignment in standard video datasets, and (2) higher memory consumption, bottlenecking the number of frames that can be processed. To mitigate the memory bottleneck, we systematically analyze the memory/accuracy trade-off of various efficient methods: factorized attention, parameter-efficient image-to-video adaptation, input masking, and multi-resolution patchification. Surprisingly, simply masking large portions of the video (up to 75%) during contrastive pre-training proves to be one of the most robust ways to scale encoders to videos up to 4.3 minutes at 1 FPS. Our simple approach for training long video-to-text models, which scales to 1B parameters, does not add new architectural complexity and is able to outperform the popular paradigm of using much larger LLMs as an information aggregator over segment-based information on benchmarks with long-range temporal dependencies (YouCook2, EgoSchema).

# Learned representation-guided diffusion models for large-image generation

## Authors

## Abstract
To synthesize high-fidelity samples, diffusion models typically require auxiliary data to guide the generation process. However, it is impractical to procure the painstaking patch-level annotation effort required in specialized domains like histopathology and satellite imagery; it is often performed by domain experts and involves hundreds of millions of patches. Modern-day self-supervised learning (SSL) representations encode rich semantic and visual information. In this paper, we posit that such representations are expressive enough to act as proxies to fine-grained human labels. We introduce a novel approach that trains diffusion models conditioned on embeddings from SSL. Our diffusion models successfully project these features back to high-quality histopathology and remote sensing images. In addition, we construct larger images by assembling spatially consistent patches inferred from SSL embeddings, preserving long-range dependencies. Augmenting real data by generating variations of real images improves downstream classifier accuracy for patch-level and larger, image-scale classification tasks. Our models are effective even on datasets not encountered during training, demonstrating their robustness and generalizability. Generating images from learned embeddings is agnostic to the source of the embeddings. The SSL embeddings used to generate a large image can either be extracted from a reference image, or sampled from an auxiliary model conditioned on any related modality (e.g. class labels, text, genomic data). As proof of concept, we introduce the text-to-large image synthesis paradigm where we successfully synthesize large pathology and satellite images out of text descriptions.

# GenHowTo: Learning to Generate Actions and State Transformations from Instructional Videos

## Authors
Tomáš Souček, Dima Damen, Michael Wray, Ivan Laptev, Josef Sivic

## Abstract
We address the task of generating temporally consistent and physically plausible images of actions and object state transformations. Given an input image and a text prompt describing the targeted transformation, our generated images preserve the environment and transform objects in the initial image. Our contributions are threefold. First, we leverage a large body of instructional videos and automatically mine a dataset of triplets of consecutive frames corresponding to initial object states, actions, and resulting object transformations. Second, equipped with this data, we develop and train a conditioned diffusion model dubbed GenHowTo. Third, we evaluate GenHowTo on a variety of objects and actions and show superior performance compared to existing methods. In particular, we introduce a quantitative evaluation where GenHowTo achieves 88% and 74% on seen and unseen interaction categories, respectively, outperforming prior work by a large margin.

# Semi-supervised Active Learning for Video Action Detection

## Authors
Aayush Singh, Aayush J Rana, Akash Kumar, Shruti Vyas, Yogesh Singh Rawat

## Abstract
In this work, we focus on label efficient learning for video action detection. We develop a novel semi-supervised active learning approach which utilizes both labeled as well as unlabeled data along with informative sample selection for action detection. Video action detection requires spatio-temporal localization along with classification, which poses several challenges for both active learning informative sample selection as well as semi-supervised learning pseudo label generation. First, we propose NoiseAug, a simple augmentation strategy which effectively selects informative samples for video action detection. Next, we propose fft-attention, a novel technique based on high-pass filtering which enables effective utilization of pseudo label for SSL in video action detection by emphasizing on relevant activity region within a video. We evaluate the proposed approach on three different benchmark datasets, UCF-101-24, JHMDB-21, and Youtube-VOS. First, we demonstrate its effectiveness on video action detection where the proposed approach outperforms prior works in semi-supervised and weakly-supervised learning along with several baseline approaches in both UCF101-24 and JHMDB-21. Next, we also show its effectiveness on Youtube-VOS for video object segmentation demonstrating its generalization capability for other dense prediction tasks in videos.

# Text2AC-Zero: Consistent Synthesis of Animated Characters using 2D Diffusion

## Authors
Abdelrahman Eldesokey, Peter Wonka

## Abstract
We propose a zero-shot approach for consistent Text-to-Animated-Characters synthesis based on pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models. Existing Text-to-Video (T2V) methods are expensive to train and require large-scale video datasets to produce diverse characters and motions. At the same time, their zero-shot alternatives fail to produce temporally consistent videos. We strive to bridge this gap, and we introduce a zero-shot approach that produces temporally consistent videos of animated characters and requires no training or fine-tuning. We leverage existing text-based motion diffusion models to generate diverse motions that we utilize to guide a T2I model. To achieve temporal consistency, we introduce the Spatial Latent Alignment module that exploits cross-frame dense correspondences that we compute to align the latents of the video frames. Furthermore, we propose Pixel-Wise Guidance to steer the diffusion process in a direction that minimizes visual discrepancies. Our proposed approach generates temporally consistent videos with diverse motions and styles, outperforming existing zero-shot T2V approaches in terms of pixel-wise consistency and user preference.

# CCM: Adding Conditional Controls to Text-to-Image Consistency Models

## Authors
Jie Xiao, Kai Zhu, Han Zhang, Zhiheng Liu, Yujun Shen, Yu Liu, Xueyang Fu, Zheng-Jun Zha

## Abstract
Consistency Models (CMs) have showed a promise in creating visual content efficiently and with high quality. However, the way to add new conditional controls to the pretrained CMs has not been explored. In this technical report, we consider alternative strategies for adding ControlNet-like conditional control to CMs and present three significant findings. 1) ControlNet trained for diffusion models (DMs) can be directly applied to CMs for high-level semantic controls but struggles with low-level detail and realism control. 2) CMs serve as an independent class of generative models, based on which ControlNet can be trained from scratch using Consistency Training proposed by Song et al. 3) A lightweight adapter can be jointly optimized under multiple conditions through Consistency Training, allowing for the swift transfer of DMs-based ControlNet to CMs. We study these three solutions across various conditional controls, including edge, depth, human pose, low-resolution image and masked image with text-to-image latent consistency models.

# LoRA-Enhanced Distillation on Guided Diffusion Models

## Authors
Pareesa Ameneh Golnari

## Abstract
Diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), offer the ability to generate high-resolution images with diverse features, but they come at a significant computational and memory cost. In classifier-free guided diffusion models, prolonged inference times are attributed to the necessity of computing two separate diffusion models at each denoising step. Recent work has shown promise in improving inference time through distillation techniques, teaching the model to perform similar denoising steps with reduced computations. However, the application of distillation introduces additional memory overhead to these already resource-intensive diffusion models, making it less practical.   To address these challenges, our research explores a novel approach that combines Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with model distillation to efficiently compress diffusion models. This approach not only reduces inference time but also mitigates memory overhead, and notably decreases memory consumption even before applying distillation. The results are remarkable, featuring a significant reduction in inference time due to the distillation process and a substantial 50% reduction in memory consumption. Our examination of the generated images underscores that the incorporation of LoRA-enhanced distillation maintains image quality and alignment with the provided prompts. In summary, while conventional distillation tends to increase memory consumption, LoRA-enhanced distillation offers optimization without any trade-offs or compromises in quality.
